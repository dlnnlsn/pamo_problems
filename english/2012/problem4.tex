    The numbers $\frac{1}{1}, \frac{1}{2}, \dots, \frac{1}{2012}$ are written on the blackboard. A\"icha chooses any two numbers from the blackboard, say $x$ and $y$, erases them and she writes instead the number $x + y + xy$. She continues to do this until only one number is left on the board. What are the possible values of the final number?
