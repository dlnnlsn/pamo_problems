    Let $n \geq 1$ be an integer. A child builds a wall along a line with $n$ identical cubes. He lays the first cube on the line and at each subsequent step, he lays the next cube either on the ground or on top of another cube so that it has a common face with the previous one.

    Let $u_n$ be the number of such distinct walls.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Find $u_1$, $u_2$, $u_3$, and $u_4$.
        \item Determine $u_n$ in terms of $n$.
    \end{enumerate}
