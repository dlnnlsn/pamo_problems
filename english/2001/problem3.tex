    Let $ABC$ be an equilateral triangle and let $P_0$ be a point which is outside this triangle such that triangle $AP_0 C$ is isosceles with a right angle at $P$. We set $AP_0 = a$.

    A fly starts from point $P_0$ and turns around triangle $ABC$ as follows:

    From $P_0$ the fly goes to $P_1$ which is the symmetric point of $P_0$ with respect to $A$. From $P_1$ it goes to $P_2$ which is the symmetric point of $P_1$ with respect to $B$ and then to $P_3$ the symmetric point of $P_2$ with respect to $C$, then to $P_3$ with respect to $A$ and so on. Compare the distances $P_0 P_1$ and $P_0 P_n$ for all $n$.
