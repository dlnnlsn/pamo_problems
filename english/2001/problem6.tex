    $S1$ is a semicircle with centre $O$ and diameter $AB$. A circle $C1$ with centre $P$ is drawn tangent at $O$ to $AB$ and tangent to $S1$. A semicircle $S2$ is drawn with centre $Q$ on $AB$, tangent to $C1$ and to $S1$. A circle $C2$ with centre $R$ is drawn, internally tangent to $S1$ and externally tangent to $S2$ and $C1$.

    Prove that $OPRQ$ is a rectangle.
