    Consider $n$ children in a playground, where $n \geq 2$. Every child has a coloured hat, and every pair of children is joined by a coloured ribbon. For every child, the colour of each ribbon held is different, and also different from the colour of that child's hat. What is the minimum number of colours that needs to be used?
