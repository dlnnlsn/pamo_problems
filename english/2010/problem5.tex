    A sequence $a_0, a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n, \dots$ of positive integers is constructed as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item if the last digit of $a_n$ is less than or equal to $5$ then this digit is deleted and $a_{n + 1}$ is the number consisting of the remaining digits. (If $a_{n + 1}$ contains no digits the process stops.)
        \item otherwise $a_{n + 1} = 9 a_n$.
    \end{itemize}
    Can one choose $a_0$ so that an infinite sequence is obtained?
