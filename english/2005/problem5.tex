\begin{document}
    Noah has to fit $8$ species of animals into $4$ cages of the Ark. He plans to put two species of animals in each cage. It turns out that, for each species of animal, there are at most $3$ other species with which it cannot share a cage. Prove that there is a way to assign the animals to the cages such that each species shares a cage with a compatible species.
