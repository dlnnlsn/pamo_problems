    Let $ABCD$ be a trapezium such that the sides $AB$ and $CD$ are parallel and the side $AB$ is longer than the side $CD$. Let $M$ and $N$ be on the segments $AB$ and $BC$ respectively, such that each of the segments $CM$ and $AN$ divides the trapezium in two parts of equal area.

    Prove that the segment $MN$ intersects the segment $BD$ at its midpoint.
