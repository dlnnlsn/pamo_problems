    Consider an $n \times n$ grid formed by $n^2$ unit squares. We define the center of a unit square as the intersection of its diagonals.

    Find the smallest integer $m$ such that, choosing any $m$ unit squares in the grid, we always get four unit squares among them whose centers are vertices of a parallelogram.
