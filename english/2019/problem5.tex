\begin{document}
    A square is divided into $N^2$ equal smaller non-overlapping squares, where $N \geq 3$. We are given a broken line which passes through the centres of all the smaller squares (such a broken line may intersect itself).
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item Show that it is possible to find a broken line composed of $4$ segments for $N = 3$.
        \item Find the minimum number of segments in this broken line for arbitrary $N$.
    \end{enumerate}
